# Latest LinkedIn Carousel Maker Complete List (Including Design Features)

Posting static images on LinkedIn isn't cutting it anymore. Your audience scrolls past single posts in seconds, but carousels stop the scroll and demand attention. Creating multi-slide content that flows smoothly takes either design skills you don't have or hours you can't spare. LinkedIn carousel makers solve this by turning your ideas into polished, swipeable posts in minutes rather than days.

## **[CreateCarousel](https://www.createcarousel.com)**

Free multi-platform carousel creation with AI content generation.

![CreateCarousel Screenshot](image/createcarousel.webp)


CreateCarousel handles carousel design for LinkedIn, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, Facebook, and Pinterest from a single interface. The platform stands out by offering genuinely free access without forcing you into paid plans to unlock basic functionality. You get 25+ professionally designed templates covering business, marketing, education, and personal branding topics.

The AI-powered content generator creates complete carousel scripts based on your topic input. Select your tone of voice and preferred language, then the system drafts text for every slide that you can edit and refine. This speeds up the ideation phase dramatically—instead of staring at blank slides wondering what to write, you start with structured content that just needs personalization.

Carousels created on the platform leverage algorithmic advantages built into social platforms. When someone sees your carousel but doesn't swipe, the algorithm shows them a different slide from the same post to test whether another angle captures interest. This gives your content multiple chances to engage the same viewer, increasing overall impression counts without creating separate posts.

The drag-and-drop editor lets you customize colors, fonts, images, and layouts to match your brand identity. Export options include PDF format for LinkedIn uploads or individual image files for other platforms. The multi-platform approach means creating once and adapting for different channels rather than starting from scratch for each network.

**Best for solopreneurs, marketers, and content creators who need cross-platform carousel design without subscription costs, plus AI assistance to overcome writer's block.**

## FAQ

**Do carousel maker tools work for platforms beyond LinkedIn?**

Most modern carousel makers support multiple platforms including LinkedIn, Instagram, Twitter, TikTok, and Facebook. Tools like CreateCarousel, Predis.ai, and VDraw automatically adjust dimensions and formatting for different networks. LinkedIn carousels require PDF upload (created from images), while Instagram uses native multi-image posts. Check each tool's export options to confirm it supports your target platforms. Some tools specialize in LinkedIn while others prioritize Instagram or offer equal multi-platform support.

**Can AI-generated carousel content sound authentic to my brand voice?**

AI carousel generators like PostNitro and aiCarousels let you specify tone, style, and language preferences to match your brand voice. The AI provides starting content that you edit and personalize rather than publishing verbatim. Most successful creators use AI for structure and first drafts, then inject personality during editing. Tools that learn from your previous content (like Supergrow) adapt better to your specific voice over time. The key is treating AI output as a time-saving foundation rather than finished copy.

**What's the ideal number of slides for LinkedIn carousel posts?**

LinkedIn supports up to 10 carousel slides (created from a PDF with 10 pages/images). Engagement data shows 5-8 slides typically perform best—long enough to provide value but short enough that viewers complete the swipe sequence. Educational content works well with 6-7 slides for step-by-step explanations. Listicles engage with 5 slides highlighting key points. Story-driven carousels maintain interest through 8-10 slides. Test different lengths and monitor completion rates to find what resonates with your specific audience.
